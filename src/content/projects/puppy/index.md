Puppy is a lightweight yet powerful CRM built for Smart-Tech Enterprise to streamline client service tracking and billing. It ensures that when Smart-Tech employees visit client locations, their work hours are accurately recorded, and billing is automated. With GeoFencing integration, Puppy provides real-time tracking, ensuring employees log their hours within designated work zones.

The core objective of Puppy is to eliminate manual timekeeping, prevent billing discrepancies, and offer seamless job tracking for both employees and administrators.

#### Technical Stack:

- <b>Admin Panel:</b> CodeIgniter (PHP Framework) – Lightweight and efficient for backend operations.
- <b>Mobile App:</b> Flutter – Cross-platform mobile application (Android & iOS).
- <b>GeoFencing & Location Tracking:</b> Google APIs – Ensures employees are within client locations when logging time.

#### Key Features & Modules:

<b>Mobile App (For Employees)</b>

Designed for Smart-Tech field employees, the mobile app allows them to manage job assignments, track their working hours, and log visit details efficiently.

1. <b>Job Management</b>

    - View upcoming, ongoing, and completed jobs.
    - Start and stop time tracking with a single tap.
    - Enter visit reason and job description before starting work.

2. <b>Work Records & Logs</b>

    - Maintain detailed logs of job duration, location, and work notes.
    - Submit real-time job updates to the admin panel.
    - Automatically sync with the backend for accurate timekeeping.

3. <b>Attendance & GeoFencing</b>

    - GeoFencing ensures employees can only log time when they are at the client location.
    - Live location tracking for better employee accountability.
    - Automated attendance tracking based on job check-ins and check-outs.

<b>Admin Panel (For Smart-Tech Management)</b>

The web-based CodeIgniter admin panel gives Smart-Tech administrators full control over job assignments, employee tracking, and client billing.

1. <b>Job Forecasting & Scheduling</b>

    - Assign upcoming jobs based on project requirements.
    - Monitor job status (pending, in progress, completed).
    - Allocate employees based on skillset, availability, and location.

2. <b>Employee Attendance & Tracking</b>

    - View real-time employee locations during work hours.
    - Track login/logout times with GeoFencing validation.

    - Track pending and completed billings.
    - Automatically calculate charges based on hourly rates.
    - Export billing reports for accounting and financial analysis.

#### Business Impact & Benefits:

- <b>Reduces Billing Errors:</b> Eliminates manual entry and ensures accurate invoicing.
- <b>Ensures Compliance:</b> GeoFencing prevents fraudulent check-ins from unauthorized locations.
- <b>Enhances Productivity:</b> Employees focus on tasks instead of tracking hours manually.
- <b>Real-Time Monitoring:</b> Admins can track job progress and employee attendance remotely.
- <b>Seamless Client Management:</b> Ensures transparency in job reporting and invoicing.

#### Why Puppy Stands Out?

- <b>Smart Billing Automation:</b> Eliminates billing discrepancies for accurate invoices.
- <b>GeoFencing for Security:</b> Ensures employees log time only at designated locations.
- <b>Cross-Platform Mobile App:</b> Works seamlessly on Android & iOS with Flutter.
- <b>Scalable & Efficient:</b> Built on CodeIgniter, making it fast, lightweight, and easy to extend.
